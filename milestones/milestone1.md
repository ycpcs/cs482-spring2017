title: "Milestone 1: Formal Project Proposal"
---

**Due: Monday, Jan 30th by 12:00 PM**

Your Task
=========

Your task is to write a 1-2 page formal proposal for the project you will undertake this semester.

The report should include:

-   Who your team members are (if any)
-   Formal system requirements for the project, i.e. what behaviors will your system implement
-   A list of technologies that you will use and/or explore for the project. This should *not* include development environments, version control systems, etc. but rather languages, libraries, etc. that are necessary for the system functionality.
-   The initial use case for the minimal working system functionality

Ideally you should set up a [github](https://github.com) or [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repository with your initial milestone requirements.

Grading Criteria
================

This milestone will be graded leniently based on completeness of the requirements and initial proposed minimal system functionality.

Submitting
==========

Create a Google Doc with the proposal and share it with the instructor with edit permissions.
